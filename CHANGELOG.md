## 2.41.1
March 23, 2021

* Fix error when filtering arrays with null values

## 2.41.0
March 22, 2021

* Add `Monti.tracer.redactField(fieldName)`. Removes the value of these fields from objects before storing them in a trace. By default it filters the `password` field. Is used for headers from incoming HTTP requests, and parameters passed to methods and pub/sub.
* Reduce time spent loading the package in the server by up to 80% (from up to ~1,000ms to 200ms)
* Reduce disk usage of package from 25mb to 3mb
* Warns when an app uses multiple APM agent packages since they can conflict with each other
* Remove internal use of Meteor's HTTP package. Monti APM still instruments it to track outgoing HTTP calls in traces.
* Store `detail` property of Method and pub/sub errors (Thanks @ulion).
* Fix sending errors from Internet Explorer 9
* Documented Meteor and browser compatibility in readme. We support Meteor 1.4 and newer, and Internet Explorer 9 and newer web browsers.
* Add Tracer.stripSensitiveThorough filter. This filter internally uses a list of which fields to not strip instead of which fields to strip, which reduces the consequences of forgetting to update the filter after adding new fields
* Update Tracer.stripSensitive to support headers and request bodies for HTTP traces
* Increase minimum version for monitoring incoming HTTP requests from Meteor 1.6.1 to Meteor 1.7. As before, HTTP monitoring is automatically disabled when using an older version of Meteor.
* Drop compatibility for old beta versions of Meteor's email package. You can still force the beta version by modifying your app's `.meteor/packages` file to have a `!` after the email package's version.
* Fix filter examples in readme

## v2.40.1

* Fix some stack traces missing when logged by Meteor._debug

## v2.38
November 6, 2019

    * One had the error message without the stack
    * Another had the error stack without the message
  * Fix internal server errors with no name or stack
  * Fix empty stack from Meteor._debug on Firefox
  * Add stack if missing to Meteor._debug server errors
* Fixed duplicate `:` appearing in some error names

* Fix crash when event added to trace after it was processed
* Replace meteorhacks:kadira-profiler with montiapm:profiler in console message (@Brouilles)

## v2.36.0
May 22, 2019

* Tracer records one level of nested events
* Custom events can be added to a trace with `Monti.startEvent` and `Monti.endEvent`. These methods are only available on the server
* Optionally record a stack trace of where event started
* Added db _nextObject event, recorded during `cursor.forEach` and `cursor.map`
* Events that were ended due to the trace ending have a `forceEnd` property
* Some events uploaded to the engine have a fourth item in their array with the data needed for the above features. This is backwards compatible with the open source Kadira, but Kadira would have to be modified to use the additional data.


## v2.35.0
March 25, 2019

* Fix pubsub and system metrics that were broken in Meteor 1.8.1
* Add `recordIPAddress` option which can be used to tell Monti APM to anonymize IP addresses or to not record them. This option has no effect on the open sourced Kadira.

* Client architecture and version is sent with client errors

## v2.32.2
July 13, 2018

* Fix crashing app when unable to get cpu or memory usage on Windows. Instead, a message will be shown in the logs, and the memory and cpu usage will show as 0 in the Monti APM UI. See [#4](https://github.com/monti-apm/monti-apm-agent/issues/4)

### v2.27.3

* Update pidusage to v1.0.1
